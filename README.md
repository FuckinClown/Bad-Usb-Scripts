## FAQ

#### How do I convert this to Digispark script?

If you want to setup your Digispark, click [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6R8cveFz74)

However I should already have 2 version, one for the Ducky, and One for the Digispark

#### Why isnt it working?

There are multiple reasons why it would work:
- Incorrect Language: I program all of these in standard US QWERTY
- Not setup correctly, please go to the links below, they should fix your errors
- Simply Outdated
